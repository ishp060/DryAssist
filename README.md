Device Description: To solve the issues of excess saliva, instead of invasive surgery to reduce saliva production, our device vacuums up saliva through a plastic tube inserted into the mouth. The tube remains in place by friction with an earpiece and against the cheek. The device is coded to run on an interval, and the interval duration will be adjustable by the user. The saliva is collected in a bottle which can be emptied and cleaned once per day by a caregiver. The device creates a vacuum through the plastic tube using a motor, which is connected to the collection bottle through another small plastic tube. The motor’s connection to the collection bottle has a hydrophobic filter to prevent saliva from being vacuumed into the motor directly. The collection bottle’s larger diameter plastic tube is what vacuums saliva into the collection bottle. The bottle’s cap is removable for easy emptying.
